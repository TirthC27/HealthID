Health Record Portal

A fullstack Next.js 14 application for centralized healthcare management with patient and doctor dashboards.

Features
üè• Two Role-Based Dashboards

Patient Dashboard: Manage health records, generate QR codes, control data access

Doctor Dashboard: Access patient records, write prescriptions, scan QR codes

üîê Authentication & Security

Separate registration/login for patients and doctors

Session management with localStorage

Consent-based access control

Comprehensive audit logging

üì± QR Code Integration

Patients can generate time-limited QR codes for secure data sharing

Doctors can scan QR codes or enter HCID manually

Automatic token verification and expiration

üìä Data Management

Health records management for patients

Prescription writing for doctors

Consent management and approval flow

Activity audit trails

Tech Stack

Framework: Next.js 14 with App Router

Styling: Tailwind CSS with custom light yellow theme

Icons: Lucide React

Blockchain Storage:

Polygon (for storing metadata + transaction proofs)

Pinata (IPFS) (for decentralized storage of encrypted health records)

Local Mock Storage: localStorage (for demo & session handling)

QR Codes: Custom SVG generation

Authentication: Custom JWT-like sessions

Database & Blockchain Layer
Hybrid Data Model:

Pinata (IPFS) ‚Üí Stores encrypted health records & prescriptions off-chain (immutable storage).

Polygon Blockchain ‚Üí Stores metadata, HCIDs, access tokens, consent hashes, and transaction logs for integrity and transparency.

localStorage (Demo Mode) ‚Üí Used only for quick testing without blockchain.

Collections:

users - User accounts (patients & doctors)

patients - Patient profiles & records (encrypted ‚Üí stored in Pinata, reference hash in Polygon)

doctors - Doctor profiles

consents - Blockchain-verified permissions between patients & doctors

prescriptions - Prescriptions stored via IPFS (hash on Polygon)

audits - Audit logs anchored on-chain

qrTokens - QR tokens with expiration, verified via smart contract

Security Features

Encrypted storage of sensitive data before uploading to Pinata

Polygon smart contracts ensure:

Role-based access control

Consent validation before record retrieval

Immutable audit trails of data access and prescriptions

QR tokens verified on-chain with expiration logic

Development Notes

This is a demo application with the following notes:

Default demo uses localStorage only

Blockchain + Pinata requires:

A Polygon Mumbai/Testnet account & smart contract deployment

Pinata API key for IPFS storage

Future expansion:

Move full authentication & data to blockchain + IPFS

Add wallet-based login (MetaMask)

Enable multi-sig access for sensitive data
